Trivia Game
Repo for homework #5

What this project does

This project shows 6 trivia questions that only have 1 correct answer each. One the user clicks the 'start' button, the timer counts down until it runs out. 
The user must answer the questions within the given time limit, and a score will be calculated upon quiz completion. 

Technical approach

I created the trivia questions first and then built the 'scoring' in. After confirming that this would work for correct and incorrect answers, I implemented the timer and would leverage using 'console.log' to quickly adjust the timer when testing.

Why the project is useful

This project demonstrates the use of javascript/jQuery to look for click events, append new elements, and compare array items to the user choice (to calculate score).

How users can get started with the project

Users can interact with this game by clicking the star button, and the timer will begin. 
The user will either leave a value answered, or unanswered. 
When the timer runs out, the user will see the number of questions they got correct, incorrect, or if they were unanswered.
