Trivia Game
Repo for homework #5

What this project does

This project shows 6 trivia questions that only have 1 correct answer each. One the user clicks the 'start' button, the timer counts down until it runs out. 
The user must answer the questions within the given time limit, and a score will be calculated upon quiz completion. 

Why the project is useful

This project demonstrates the use of javascript/jQuery to look for click events, append new elements, and compare array items to the user choice (to calculate score).
